## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a web application that retrieves flight and weather information based on a user's search queries. 

Two APIs are utilized in this web app: [Flight API](https://api.flightapi.io) and [5 day weather forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) by OpenWeather.
